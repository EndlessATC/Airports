Endless ATC Heathrow v1.0 by Zac Kaplowitz

AIRAC 2104

This file does not simulate departures, as Heathrow Director almost never speaks to departures.

---------------------------------------------------------

Runway 27L and 27R are both used for arrivals - generally not together. Dual approaches are rarely used during high arrival:departure ratio periods, generally early morning arrivals from America. Dual approaches can be activated by setting the skill to 18 or above.

There are no STARs covered by Heathrow Director - aircraft are handed off descending to FL90 inbound BIG, BNN, LAM or OCK. Vectors are generally given from these points (aircraft leave the VOR on a specified heading) but can be given earlier, such as on initial contact.

The minimum separation is 3nm. Aircraft on the localiser must be separated by at least 2.5nm.

---------------------------------------------------------

Realistic traffic config:
Skill 8, cap 12
Flow 35, cap 45

Fun traffic config:
Skill 12, cap 16
Flow 55, cap 75

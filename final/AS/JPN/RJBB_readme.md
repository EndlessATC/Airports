# `RJBB` ACA 4.0.0

This is an implementation of the Kansai ACA (Approach Control Area) for [Endless ATC](https://steamcommunity.com/app/666610) featuring `RJBB` Kansai International Airport, `RJOO` Osaka International Airport (often referred to as Itami), `RJBE` Kobe Airport, `RJOS` Tokushima Airport, `RJOT` Takamatsu Airport, `RJOB` Okayama Airport, and `RJOY` Yao Airport. The airspace ceiling is FL180.

The Kansai ACA is a very complex airspace, with many airports in close vicinity in Osaka Bay and the surroundings. There are many flight paths that cross over each other, and altitude will need to used to separate aircraft very often, especially within Osaka Bay and over Osaka City. The controller will need to carefully monitor both departures and arrivals and issue altitude, speed, and vectors to ensure proper separation.

Based upon AIP Japan 2021/08/12 (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism) (https://aisjapan.mlit.go.jp/). The choice of SIDs and STARs may not be 100% accurate to real life but should be reasonably accurate reflecting daytime IMC conditions. All aircraft are assumed to be RNAV capable; no conventional NAVAID-based SIDs or STARs were implemented unless there is no RNAV procedure published. Coastline data from [naturalearthdata.com](http://www.naturalearthdata.com).

STARs are implemented as approach transitions. To activate an approach, an aircraft must be flying direct to an applicable fix, then the APP button can be activated. Multiple approaches may be available from a fix. Pressing the APP button again before issuing the approach clearance (do not long press) will select the next approach available from that fix. If the aircraft is already on an approach from that fix, you will need to cancel the approach clearance first before issuing another approach clearance.

The published STARs for the aerodromes in the Kansai ACA typically do not have "at or below" crossing restrictions. Therefore, there are few restrictions implemented, and descent earlier than the latest possible descent is at controller's discretion, which will be necessary for separation throughout the sector. You can descend aircraft below the implemented restrictions for separation purposes in most cases; any "at or above" crossing restrictions are noted below per airport.

The Tokushima ACA which exists almost entirely under the Kansai ACA, is treated as part of Kansai ACA for gameplay purposes. Note that only aircraft arriving or departing RJOS Tokushima are allowed into the Tokushima ACA airspace (areas labeled with `OS`).

The southwestern part of Kansai ACA around `RJOK` Kochi is omitted for gameplay reasons. Flight routes between `RJOO`/`RJBB` and `RJOK` are also not represented.

## Airports

### `RJBB` Kansai International Airport

The main airport of this airspace, Kansai handles both domestic and international traffic to the Kansai region (Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto, Nara, etc). Arrivals/departures will fly over RJBE Kobe to the north, and care should taken here to maintain separation of aircraft.

There is custom traffic for `RJBB`. The proportions are very much estimates but shouldn't be too far off from reality.

Many fixes visible on the map have a defined hold including some key fixes along the STARs.

Aircraft will enter the ACA and fly along their flight planned routes and hold at the last point on their route provided no further instruction is issued. Aircraft can be further cleared for the STAR & approach via any points up to and including the route endpoint. STARs can also be resumed at most points along the STAR, and aircraft can be cleared for the approach directly from the IF or FAF. The route endpoints and corresponding arrival routes are:

- `ALISA` 
	- `Y36 ALISA`: `TONBI SAEKI ALISA` (northwest from Korea/northern China)
	- `Y361 SAEKI Y36 ALISA`: `SPICE SAEKI ALISA` (northeast from NE Japan, Europe)
- `BERTH` 
	- `Y35 BERTH`: `(Y35) RANDY BERTH` (west from Fukuoka, western Japan, China)
- `BECKY`
	- `Y53 BECKY`: `KARIN BECKY` (southwest from southwestern Japan, Taiwan, HK, Singapore, Malaysia, etc.)
- `CANDY`
	- `Y46 CANDY`: `EVERT CANDY` (southwest from Philippines, south from Indonesia/Oceania, east from Nagoya/PACOTS)
- `DANDE`
	- `Y544 DANDE`: `(Y544) SINGU RIDGE DANDE` (east from `RJTT` Tokyo, `RJAA` Narita, `RJSS` Sendai, `RJSF` Fukushima)

It is recommended that arrivals via `Y544` cross `DANDE` (or `DINAH`) at 10000 for separation from arrivals to `RJOO` at 11000 over `KAINA`. An alternate route for `Y544` arrivals with a longer track is also available via `SOMEI DINAH GOBOH UBUYU DATIS`.

Aircraft depart via:

- `KEC` (east for `RJAA` Narita, PACOTS)
- `SHTLE` (east for `RJTT` Tokyo)
- `UENOH` (northeast to Tohoku, southeast Hokkaido)
- `SIGAK` (northeast to northwest Hokkaido, east NA, Europe)
- `YME` (northeast to northeastern China)
- `SOUJA` (northwest to Korea, northern China, Europe)
- `WASYU` (west to western Japan/Jeju)
- `HABAR` (west to China)
- `POPPY` (southwest to Taiwan, HK, Singapore, Malaysia, etc.)

There are two runways:

- 06R/24L (RWY A)
- 06L/24R (RWY B)

Note that simultaneous parallel independent approaches do not appear to be in use at `RJBB`. It is possible in the game, but the approaches are not built with this in mind. Of course, you can still do simultaneous parallel dependent approaches with staggered sequencing, which can help with dealing with wake turbulence separation.

The preferred runway is generally RWY A as the main terminal 1 is much closer to RWY A. LCC carriers operating from terminal 2 would have a shorter taxi from RWY B, but RWY A is often the sole runway in use.

There are two landing configurations:

-	Landing/departing RWY 06L/06R

This is the preferred configuration for `RJBB`. 

Vectors can be used for sequencing, or direct to fix shortcuts can also be issued (or both). Approaches are available from `ALLAN` and `BERRY`, and approaches from GATES are available from `JANET` and `JENNY`.

Use care not to descend arrivals into Tokushima ACA. Cross TANTA (from ALISA), NALTO (from BERTH), EVIAN, DATIS, JOLLY +6000 (at or above 6000).

Departures will be climbing over `RJBE` departures from 09, use care to maintain separation. Departures may also join paths after diverging initially especially after `MAIKO`, and may conflict with departures from `RJOO` and `RJBE` northwest of `MAIKO`. 

The published hold for missed approaches is `LILAC` +3000 for 06L, `AKASI` +4000 (via MAIKO) for 06R.

-	Landing/departing RWY 24L/24R

This is the south wind configuration for `RJBB`. 

Vectors onto the localizer should NOT be used. Approaches are available from IAF `MAYAH` (24L/24R), or IFs `AMBER` (24L) and `BEIGE` (24R). Arrivals can be vectored over the sea west of Awaji Island if needed on top of `RJBE` arrivals (watch for `RJOT` arrivals).

Use care not to descend arrivals into the `RJBE` PCA. Cross `JOLLY` (from `DANDE`) +8000, `AWAJI` +7000, `MAYAH` 4000 (**at** 4000). Strongly recommend aircraft cross `LILAC` at 4000 (descend after passing `AWAJI`). Aircraft should descend as per the approach after `MAYAH` in order to main separation from `RJBE` traffic landing 27 below descending 1600 on downwind to 800 on final.

Departures to the west will be climbing through arrivals descending to 4000 from `AWAJI` to `LILAC` to `MAYAH` and over `RJBE departures`. Departures over `DAISY` should cross `DAISY` +6000 and JULIA +8000. Departures over HELEN should cross `HELEN` +8000. Due care will need to be taken to maintain separation, such as restricting 24R departures to `HELEN` and `DAISY` to 210kts, expediting climb, etc. Recommend descending to arrivals to 4000 after `AWAJI`, and expediting climb of departures from 24R. Departures to the west may also conflict with `RJBE` departures and `RJOO` departures to the west.

Departures to the south may conflict with arrivals from `DANDE` and the south/southwest. Use caution.

### `RJOO` Osaka International Airport

An airport near the heart of Osaka, only domestic traffic is handled aside from the odd state aircraft. Mountains surround the airport to the north, west, and east.

There is custom traffic for `RJOO`. The proportions are very much estimates but shouldn't be too far off from reality.

Aircraft will enter the ACA and fly along their flight planned routes and hold at the last point on their route provided no further instruction is issued. Aircraft can be further cleared for the STAR & approach via any points up to and including the route endpoint. STARs can also be resumed at most points along the STAR, and aircraft can be cleared for the approach directly from the IF or FAF. The route endpoints and corresponding arrival routes are:

- `IKOMA` 
	- via `ROKKO`
		- `Y384 ROKKO`: `(Y384) ROKKO` (northeast from northeastern Japan)
		- `Y38 ROKKO`: `TOZAN ROKKO`  (northwest from northwestern Japan)
		- `RJBT.../RJOR YME V55.../RJOH YME V55...ROKKO`: `(GUNZE) ROKKO` (northwest from `RJBT`, `RJOR`, `RJOH`)
		- The STAR from `ROKKO` is flight planned; aircraft continue to `IKOMA` via `ROKKO KAMEO OTABE ABENO IKOMA`
	- via `KODAI`
		- `Y546 KODAI`: `OHDAI KODAI` (east from eastern Japan)
		- The STAR from `KODAI` is flight planned; aircraft continue to `IKOMA` via `KODAI MIRAI ABENO IKOMA`
- `IZUMI`
	- `Y401 KAINA Y753 IZUMI`: `RIVER ZOROH KAZRA MIRIO KAINA IZUMI` (west from western Japan for `DH8D` aircraft)
	- `Y231 MIRIO Y401 KAINA Y753 IZUMI`: `(Y231) JANGO BECKY MIRIO KAINA IZUMI` (west from western Japan)
	- `Y753 IZUMI`: `MUGIE HONMA KAINA IZUMI` -> `HONMA` -> `KAINA` -> `IZUMI` (southwest from southwestern Japan)

Aircraft depart via:

- `SHTLE` (east for Tokyo)
- `MINAC` (northeast to Tohoku, Hokkaido)
- `TOZAN` (northwest to Taiwan, HK, Singapore, Malaysia, etc.)
- `SOUJA` (west to north Kyushu)
- `WASYU` (west to western Japan, central Kyushu)
- `KRE` (southwest to southwestern Japan, south Kyushu)

There are two runways:

- 14R/32L
- 14L/32R

Larger aircraft land 14R/32L, as 14L/32R is generally only suitable for aircraft `A320`/`B738` or smaller. It is not possible to model this in the game however.

Note that simultaneous parallel independent approaches are not used at `RJOO`. It is possible in the game, but the approaches are not built with this in mind. Of course, you can still do simultaneous parallel dependent approaches with staggered sequencing, which can help with dealing with wake turbulence separation, however, this would not be used in reality as the runways are too close to each other.

Airspace to vector arrivals for sequencing is avaiable south of IKOMA/southeast of IZUMI/west of KODAI. Arrivals will fly over `RJOY` Yao, use care not to descend into `RJOY` airspace. Use care to keep separation at `KAINA`, `ROKKO` and near `IKOMA`.

West departures may conflict with other aircraft on west departures. Use caution.

The missed approach hold is `IZUMI` +3000.

There are two simple runway configurations:

-	Landing and departing 32L/32R

The preferred runway configuration.

Due to the mountains surrounding the airport, departures make a climbing left turn towards the south.

-	Landing and departing 14L/14R

This runway configuration is only used when winds do not allow for use of the 32s. Arrivals circle west of the airport to land the 14s within the mountainous surroundings.

Due to the lack of circle to land approaches in Endless ATC, aircraft make long downwind to 14. Note that in real life these aircraft would have long flown into terrain, but this is the best we can do here.

Departures may conflict with arrivals circling to 14. Use caution.

West departures may conflict with other aircraft on west departures or arrivals to `RJBE`/`RJOT`/`RJOB`. Use caution.

### `RJBE` Kobe Airport

A smaller airport in Osaka Bay minutes from central Kobe. Located under to approach to the 24s at `RJBB`, typically in-out operations landing 09 and departing 27 are ideal. Unfortunately, this is not possible in Endless ATC.

There is custom traffic for `RJBE`. The proportions are very much estimates but shouldn't be too far off from reality.

Aircraft will enter the ACA and fly along their flight planned routes and hold at the last point on their route provided no further instruction is issued. Aircraft can be further cleared for the STAR & approach via any points up to and including the route endpoint. STARs can also be resumed at most points along the STAR, and aircraft can be cleared for the approach directly from the IF or FAF. The route endpoints and corresponding arrival routes are:

- `TRACY`
	- `Y20 WAKIT Y201 TRACY`: `ARASI GINJI WAKIT TRACY` (east from eastern Japan)
	- `Y382 WAKIT Y201 TRACY`: `(Y382) WAKIT TRACY` (northeast from northeastern Japan)
- `BERTH`
	- `Y35 BERTH`: `(Y35) RANDY BERTH` (west from western Japan)
- `BECKY`
	- `Y53 BECKY`: `(Y53) KARIN BECKY` (southwest from southwestern Japan)

Aircraft depart via:

- `SHTLE` (east for Tokyo)
- `MIDER` (east to eastern Japan)
- `YME` (northeast to Tohoku/Hokkaido)
- `SOUJA` (west to north Kyushu)
- `WASYU` (west to western Japan, central Kyushu)
- `POPPY` (southwest to southwestern Japan, south Kyushu)

Aircraft arriving/departing `RJBE` in general will be operating under `RJBB` traffic. Ensure that arrivals are low enough before entering the bay, and that departures are clear of traffic above before issuing further climb.

Arrivals can be vectored over the sea west of Awaji Island (the island under `AWAJI` waypoint). If vectoring far and high, use caution for `RJOT` arrivals descending from `WAKIT` southwest towards `POPAI`.

Departures may conflict with other aircraft on west departures or arrivals to `RJOT`/`RJOB`. Use caution.

The missed approach hold is `SIOJI` +3000.

There are two simple runway configurations:

-	Landing and departing 09

The preferred runway configuration. 

Departures make a climbing right turn to **1500** to depart to the west remaining under `RJBB` departures and over `RJBE` arrivals. The controller will need to issue to climb past 4000 to stay above arrivals to 09 before joining the outbound course to `MAIKO`. If `RJBB` is landing 24s, departures need to keep below `RJBB` arrivals passing `MAYAH` at 4000 descending to 2600.

-	Landing and departing 27

The west wind configuration.

Arrivals circle to land 27; however as Endless ATC does not have circle to land approaches, arrivals make a long downwind to 27. They should be able to maintain separation even while turning to base with RJBB arrivals leaving 2600. 

Departures will climb straight out to **3000** bound for `MAIKO`. Use caution not to issue further climb before clear of `RJBB` arrivals.

### `RJOS` Tokushima Airport

A joint-use civilian airport and JSDF-M base. Training operations with Beech King Airs are conducted by the JSDF-M from this base, and there are occasionally transiting JSDF aircraft. Typically in-out operations landing 29 and departing 11 are ideal; unfortunately, this is not possible in Endless ATC.

There is custom traffic for `RJOS`. The proportions are very much estimates but shouldn't be too far off from reality.

Aircraft will enter the ACA and fly along their flight planned routes and hold at the last point on their route provided no further instruction is issued. Aircraft can be further cleared for the approach via any points up to and including the route endpoint. Aircraft can also be cleared for the approach directly from the IF or FAF. The route endpoints and corresponding arrival routes are:

- `DATIS`
	- `Y544 SINGU Y542 DATIS`: `SINGU SOMEI DINAH GOBOH UBUYU DATIS` (east from Tokyo)
- `TSC`
	- `KEC JOSIN TSC`: `(KEC30) JOSIN TSC` (southeast from training areas?)
	- `Y33 KTE KULUL TSC`: `SAKAI KOMPI KTE KULUL TSC` (west from Fukuoka)

Aircraft depart via:

- `KMANO` -> `KILAP` (east for Tokyo)
- `KTE` -> `WASYU` (west to Fukuoka)
- `TOSAR` (south to training areas?)

Departures may conflict with other aircraft on southwest departures and `RJBB` `BECKY`/`CANDY` arrivals. Use caution.

Radar vectors to `DATIS` or to final for ILS 29 are possible options for arrivals from `JOSIN` instead of the ILS from `TSC`.

The missed approach hold is `TSC`/`DATIS` +3000.

There are two simple runway configurations:

-	Landing and departing 29

The preferred runway configuration. Departures make a climbing left turn to depart to the southeast.

-	Landing and departing 11

This runway configuration is used when winds do not allow straight-in 29. Arrivals circle to land 11, however as Endless ATC does not have circle to land approaches, arrivals make a long downwind to 11.

### `RJOT` Takamatsu Airport

An airport nestled up against mountains to the south serving Takamatsu.

There is custom traffic for `RJOT`. The proportions are very much estimates but shouldn't be too far off from reality.

Aircraft will enter the ACA and fly along their flight planned routes and hold at the last point on their route provided no further instruction is issued. Aircraft can be further cleared for the STAR & approach via any points up to and including the route endpoint. STARs can also be resumed at most points along the STAR, and aircraft can be cleared for the approach directly from the IF or FAF. The route endpoints and corresponding arrival routes are:

- `WIMPY`
	- `Y20 WAKIT Y203 WIMPY` (east)
- `KTE`
	- `Y288 TAKMA KTE`: `TAKMA KTE` (west/southwest)
	- `Y39 OYE KTE`: `YUBAR OYE KTE` (northwest)

Aircraft depart via:

- `SHTLE` (east)
- `WASYU` (west)
- `MIHOU` (north)

The missed approach hold is `KTE` +5000.

There are two simple runway configurations:

-	Landing and departing 26

The preferred runway configuration.

-	Landing and departing 11

This runway configuration is used when winds do not allow straight-in 26. Arrivals circle to land 11, however as Endless ATC does not have circle to land approaches, arrivals make a long downwind to 11.

### `RJOB` Okayama Airport

An airport situated in the mountains serving Okayama.

There is custom traffic for `RJOB`. The proportions are very much estimates but shouldn't be too far off from reality.

Aircraft will enter the ACA and fly along their flight planned routes and hold at the last point on their route provided no further instruction is issued. Aircraft can be further cleared for the approach via any points up to and including the route endpoint. Aircraft can also be cleared for the approach directly from the IF or FAF. The route endpoints and corresponding arrival routes are:

- `OYE`
	- `Y20 WAKIT Y205 OYE`: `ARASI GINJI WAKIT TRIPY MIMMY SIMAG BENES OYE` (east)
	- `Y382 WAKIT Y205 OYE`: `(Y382) WAKIT TRIPY MIMMY SIMAG BENES OYE` (northeast)
	- `Y39 OYE`: `YUBAR OYE` (northwest)
	- `Y288 INOOK OYE`: `TAKMA INOOK OYE` (west/southwest)

Aircraft depart via:

- `SHTLE` (east)
- `YME` (northeast)
- `YUBAR` (north)
- `WASYU` (west)

The missed approach hold is `OYE`/`BENES` +4000.

There are two simple runway configurations:

-	Landing and departing 07

The preferred runway configuration for arrivals from the west. A straight-in ILS approach for arrivals from `TAKMA` is available via `INOOK`. A RNAV RNP approach utilizing RF legs to circle to 07 from the east is available in reality but the final leg is too short to be reproducible in Endless ATC. Therefore, east arrivals fly the ILS approach from `OYE`.

-	Landing and departing 25

The preferred runway configuration for arrivals from the east. The straight-in to 25 is an RNAV RNP approach as there is no ILS for 25. A transition to final is available from `BENES`.

### `RJOY` Yao Airport

A small airport near Osaka that acts as a general aviation hub.

There is custom traffic for `RJOY`. The proportions are very much estimates but shouldn't be too far off from reality.

Aircraft will enter the ACA and fly along their flight planned routes and hold at the last point on their route provided no further instruction is issued. Aircraft can be further cleared for the approach via any points up to and including the route endpoint. Aircraft can also be cleared for the approach directly from the IF or FAF. The route endpoints and corresponding arrival routes are:

- `IZUMI`
	- `V28 ITE V55 IZUMI`: `MIDER ITE IZUMI` (east)
	- `(YME) V55 IZUMI`: `GUNZE ROKKO SANDA ITE IZUMI` (north)
	- `Y384 ROKKO V55 IZUMI`: `(Y384) ROKKO SANDA ITE IZUMI` (northeast)
	- `Y38 ROKKO V55 IZUMI`: `TOZAN ROKKO SANDA ITE IZUMI` (northwest)
	- `(KRE) KAIFU IZARI MIKAN IZUMI`: `KAIFU IZARI MIKAN IZUMI` (southwest)
	- `V28 ITE V55 IZUMI`: `WASYU OYE OLIVE AYAYA BUMER ARIMA ITE IZUMI` (west)
	- `Y33 KTE KULUL TSC MIKAN IZUMI`: `SAKAI KOMPI KTE KULUL TSC MIKAN IZUMI` (west)
	- `V55 IZUMI`: `NORAN OSAMU IYOKA IZUMI` (southeast)

Aircraft depart via:

- `KCC` via `ASUKA` (east)
- `KRE` via `IZUMI`, `KAIFU` (southwest)
- `YME` via `IZUMI` (north)
- `YUBAR` via `IZUMI`, `ITE`, `OYE` (northwest)
- `WASYU` via `IZUMI`, `ITE`, `OYE` (west)
- `NORAN` via `IZUMI` (southeast)

The missed approach hold is `IZUMI` +4200.

The only instrument approaches available are a VORDME or VOR circling approach from `IZUMI`. The VORDME approach is implemented with circling to all runways. Runway 13/31 is not enabled at this time, but can be easily enabled by editing [configurations] as the other relevant data is all there.

There is a very high potential for conflicts to the west of the airport. The airport and the VORDME approach sit under the approach path for `RJOO` traffic via `IZUMI`, so you effectively have a ceiling of 5000 to work with when there is traffic overhead. Alternatively, you can vector `RJOO` arrivals to the south to clear the airspace overhead.

Aircraft inbound to `IZUMI` via V55 from `ITE` will need to stay above `RJOO` departures and `RJBB` arrivals, while staying below `RJBB` `NANKO` departures, `RJOO` arrivals via `IZUMI`, and `RJOY` `ASUKA` departures. Aircraft departing via `IZUMI` (V55) `ITE` will also need to separated from opposite direction inbound traffic. Any aircraft going missed will also need to be separated from other `RJOY` arrivals, and in the case of landing 09, from aircraft inbound the `RJOO` 32s.

There are two simple runway configurations:

-	Landing and departing 27

The calm wind configuration. Use care for `ASUKA` departures; keep them separated from arrivals inbound `IZUMI` from `ITE`, and climb them above aircraft on final for `RJOO`.

-	Landing and departing 09

The reverse configuration. Use care for `ASUKA` departures to keep them separated from arrivals inbound `IZUMI` from `ITE`.

## Known Issues

- Circle to land approaches make a long downwind (a short final is not possible in game)
- `Y401` arrivals to `RJOO` aren't restricted to `DH8D` (not possible in game)
- `KAIFU` arrivals to `RJOO` aren't restricted to other props (not possible in game)

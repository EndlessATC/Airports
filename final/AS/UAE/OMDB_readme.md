Endless ATC Dubai CTA v1.0 by Zac Kaplowitz

AIRAC 2102

v1.0 only covers OMDB (Dubai International Airport) in the 30 configuration. The 12 configuration is not yet included. Sharjah and Al Maktoum are not yet included. The Minhad restricted airspace is not yet included.

30L is for arrivals, 30R is for departures. The platform altitude for 30L is 2000 feet. All departures maintain initially 4000ft. Airspace from 1500-FL150.

On initial contact, arriving aircraft should be cleared for the arrival.

The minimum separation in the CTA is 3nm. The minimum separation on the same localiser is 2.5nm. Aircraft on the same SID must be handed off to UAE Radar with at least 8nm in trail.

Even altitudes are used for arrivals and odd altitudes for departures. This is ignored below 4000ft, as 3000ft is used to separate arrivals more efficiently.

Arrival procedures
PUVAL5C

If there are no IVURO departures, direct GIRGO/VELAR/RIDEV may be given.

# Custom airport file
# Save a copy of example.txt before editing it, to keep this file as a guide.
# On Windows, place the txt file in the /locations/ folder of the game.
# On android, place the txt file in /Android/data/com.dirgtrats.endlessatc/files/.
# Copy, edit and use and share airport files at your own risk!

# This example file has lots of comments (#), to use it as a guide
# Uncomment the 'code = ' item in the [airport1] section below to make the airport appear in-game.

# This file has several [sections] (but most are optional), namely:
# [airspace]: various general properties
# [airport1]: main airport
# [airport2]: optional secondary airports
# [area1]: optional restricted areas
# [configurations]: optional runway usage configurations
# [departure1]: optional runway departure routes
# [approach1]: optional runway approach routes
# [planetypes]: optional custom plane types
# [scenario]: optional nonrandom traffic

# Each section can have multiple items, each item with one or more properties. The format/order of properties are explained after a double hashtag (##) in this file.
# Properties are comma separated. Multi-line properties (lists) MUST start with a tab or space at the beginning of each line.
# Properties in this file that are explained between <brackets> are optional properties (do not include the brackets themselves).
# If the game fails to load a property, or you omit, #comment or zero a property, the game may automatically use a default value instead.
# Positions must be given either in x, y coordinates (in nautical miles, NM), with 0, 0 being the center of the screen, and 20.1, 12.82 being somewhere at the top left,
# or, in latitude, longitude coordinates, which must always start with a N/W/S/E prefix, for example N40.7128, W74.0060 or S049.43.45.000, E002.09.51.000 (DMS notation).
# Lat/long coordinates (and true headings) are rotated automatically when a magnetic variance is defined; this is to align the radar display with the magnetic north,
# to make a heading of 360 degrees appear as a vertical line on the radar screen.
# X, y coordinates are simple screen coordinates; they are not rotated.
# Either way, all positions consist of two values, seperated by a comma. Whether you want to use x,y or latlong coordinates is up to you.
# For real world data it is probably easier to search the internet for the actual latlong coordinates.
# Press the left Ctrl key in the sim to display the coordinates of the mouse position. These values are also copied into the Windows clipboard, to be easily pasted into a file.

# This example file has lots of comments (#), to use it as a guide
# Uncomment the 'code = ' item in the [airport1] section below to make the airport appear in-game.

# This file has several [sections] (but most are optional), namely:
# [airspace]: various general properties
# [airport1]: main airport
# [airport2]: optional secondary airports
# [area1]: optional restricted areas
# [configurations]: optional runway usage configurations
# [departure1]: optional runway departure routes
# [approach1]: optional runway approach routes
# [planetypes]: optional custom plane types
# [scenario]: optional nonrandom traffic
# [background]: optional lines drawn on the background

# Each section can have multiple items, each item with one or more properties. The format/order of properties are explained after a double hashtag (##) in this file.
# Properties are comma separated. Multi-line properties (lists) MUST start with a tab or space at the beginning of each line.
# Properties in this file that are explained between <brackets> are optional properties (do not include the brackets themselves).
# If the game fails to load a property, or you omit or #comment or zero a property, the game may automatically use a default value instead.
# Coordinates can be given as a latitude longitude pair.
# Lat/Long formatting examples (all pointing to the same location):
# N51.47176, W0.457859
# 51째28'18.336''N, 0째27'28.2924''W
# 51째28'18N, 0째27'28W
# And when setting 'decimaldegrees' to true, then N/S/W/E letters are not required so you can simply use decimal degrees:
# 51.47176, -0.457859
# Lat/long coordinates (and true headings) are rotated automatically when a magnetic variance is defined; this is to align the radar display with the magnetic north,
# to make a heading of 360 degrees appear as a vertical line on the radar screen.
# When decimaldegrees = false, decimal coordinates are interpreted as x, y (in nautical miles), with 0, 0 being the center of the screen.
# Press the left Ctrl key in the sim to display the coordinates of the mouse position. These values are also copied into the Windows clipboard, to be easily pasted into a file.
